# LearnYourRudiments
<b> Mobile web app designed for drummers who are just starting out and want to learn some rudiments. This was my first HTML/CSS + JavaScript project and it explored Human-Centered Design through the PACT Framework. It also uses NexusUI and ToneJS.</b>

Drum rudiments are the building blocks for almost every drum beat, pattern, fill or solo. 

This app presents 6 rudiments to choose from, and displays the pattern in the screen. Instructions on how to read the rudiments are provided by clicking in the Info icon. Also, there is an animation showing the user how to play the rudiment.

The user can adjust the speed of the audio playback and the animation by using the BPM slider. They can then practice (maybe with their two thumbs while holding the phone) in the Practice Area. The phone vibrates at the same rate of the metronome, so that the user can practice even in loud places.
An Example button is provided which plays back a drum beat that the user can create just using the drum rudiment selected.
